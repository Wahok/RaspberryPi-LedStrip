Connect the MOSFETs ###\r\n- If you look **at the front** of the MOSFETs:\r\n\t- The first pin from left is the **Gate**\r\n\t- The second one the **Drain**\r\n\t- The third one the **Source**\r\n- Just put the three MOSFETs onto your breadboard\r\n- Connect the Source pins with the ground bus of your breadboard \r\n\r\n![Connecting the MOSFETs](http://mosfets)    \r\n\r\n### 2. Connect the LED-Strip ###\r\n- Connect for each color the **Drain** pin with the associated color of the LED-Strip\r\n- Put a wire from the 12V pin of the LED-Strip to the supply voltage bus of the breadboard\r\n\r\n![Connecting the LED-Strip](http://led-strip)    \r\n\r\n### 3. Connect the Raspberry Pi ###\r\n![Overview over the GPIO pins](http://gpios) Image source [raspberrypi-spy.co.uk](raspberrypi-spy.co.uk \"Image Source\")    \r\n- Connect one of the ground pins with the ground bus of the breadboard\r\n- Connect for each color one of the green pins with the **Gate** of the MOSFETs\r\n\t- I will use: \r\n\t\t- **GPIO17** for Red\r\n\t\t- **GPIO22** for Green\r\n\t\t- **GPIO24** for Blue\r\n\r\n![Connecting the Raspberry Pi](http://raspberry)    \r\n\r\n### 4. Connect the Extra-low voltage connector ###\r\n- If you have one with Screws:\r\n\t- Fasten one wire with the ground and one withe the voltage part in place\r\n- Connect the ground wire with the ground bus of the breadboard\r\n- Connect the voltage wire with the voltage bus of the breadboard\r\n- Connect your Power Adapter with the Extra-low voltage connector\r\n- Plug in your Power Adapter\r\n\r\n![Connecting the Extra-low voltage connector](http://connector)    \r\n\r\n### 5. Testing ###\r\n- Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH or Terminal\r\n- Type into your console:\r\n\t- `echo \"17=1\" > /dev/pi-blaster` and your LED should be red\r\n\t- `echo \"22=0.5\" > /dev/pi-blaster` and your LED should be yellow\r\n\t- `echo \"24=0.5\" > /dev/pi-blaster` and your LED should be purple\r\n\r\n### What now? ###\r\n- Now you can do everything with your LED-Strip\r\n\t- For example you can use python to control the LED-Strip\r\n\t- With `os.system(\"echo PIN=BRIGHTNESS > /dev/pi-blaster\")` you can echo to **/dev/pi-blaster**\r\n\t- You can also try my fading script: [http://fading](http://fading \"Python Fading\")\r\n- If you have questions, feel free to ask!",
